Balder2D is currently under development and may have flaws in it in the form 
of minor and/or major bugs.  We are always looking for things that we might 
have overlooked, so if you find a bug we would like to know about it.  
This way we can fix it as promptly as possible.

Please submit any bug reports that you might have to our bug tracking system at:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=49631&atid=699305

or e-mail our Project Administrator:

Thank you and we hope you enjoy the game!
